# Finance App Work Simulation

Welcome to the JavaScript (Node.JS) Finance App work simulation by [Hatchways](http://hatchways.io/). In this project, you will be writing a couple of back-end API routes on a Node/Express back-end API that is located in the [server folder](./server). Below is some high level detail about the project. Good luck!

## Server

Please refer to the [server README](server/README.md) for server setup instructions.

## Tips

### Provided functions

The project contains helper functions you can use to complete your tasks without writing any SQL or ORM logic:
* `Account.getAccountsByUserId` in the [models folder](./server/models/account.js) can be used to fetch all account details
* `Transaction.getTransactionsForRange` in the [models folder](./server/models/transaction.js) can be used to fetch transaction data by date

### Seed data

We've included sample data that the application has been configured to use. For more information on how the database is set up, please reference [Database Setup](./server/README.md#Database-Setup).
